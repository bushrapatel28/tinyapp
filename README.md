### Helper Functions

- `getUserByEmail(formEmail, database)`: Looks up the `database` for a user email that matches the `formEmail`. Returns the userId of that user from the `database`. Returns `undefined` if match not found.

- `urlsForUser(id, urlDatabase)`: Looks up the `urlDatabase` for the user id that matches the `id`. Returns the url object, from the `urlDatabase`, for the `id`. Returns an empty object if match not found.

- `getLoggedInUser(formEmail, formPassword, database)`: Looks up the `database` for a user email that matches the `formEmail`, then compares and matches the user password to the `formPassword`. Returns the userId of the user, from the `database`, who's email and password match. Returns `undefined` if match not found.
